# odin-recipes

This is the first project within the odin project. The assignment is to make a
recipe site. There needs to be a main page, with links to each of the separate 
recipes each with thier own page. On the recipe page there needs to be an image
of the finished dish. An ingredients list with an unordered list. Then a list of
steps in an ordered list. There should be 3 or so recipes. 

I hope to better understand the use of the html elements and tags by the end of 
project. My goal is to go with 4 recipes with links to each from the homepage. 
I'm going to need a link back to the homepage from each of the recipe pages. I 
also may want to put a "Check out these other recipe" section at the bottom of 
each recipe page that links to each of the other pages. 

I am looking forward to including the git workflow into this project and getting
a better understanding of how git works and seeing it in action in this project.
